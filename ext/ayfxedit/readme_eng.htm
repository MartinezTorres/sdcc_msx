<p id=txt class=lfx>
AY Sound FX Editor is a complete solution to create sound effects for AY-3-8910 sound chip. The effects could be used in games or other software for ZX Spectrum. It is also possible to use them with other micro computers that use the AY-3-8910. The package includes cross editor itself (a Windows software), an example of simple sound effects player with Z80 assembly source code, compiled example, and a library of sound effects.
<br><br>
The editor allows to create single channel sound effects with duration up to 4096 TV frames. Frame duration is 1/50s, so maximum effect duration is about 80 seconds. Volume, noise and mixer settings can be changed every frame. Data is stored in a compact format that omits repeating values. Effects are combined into banks, up to 256 effects. Effects player works with a bank, an effect is played using its order number in the bank.
<br><br>
It should be noted that the editor can't create effects on its own, it only allows to edit AY registers data in easy way. It is quite similar to the sample editors in AY music trackers. You have to know how the AY sound chip works in order to get desired results. However, the editor allows to import data from various formats, that could make things easier.

<br>
Below the main menu there is a bar with a number of controls. When you hover the mouse above them, a hint is displayed.
<br><br>
At the left of the bar there are three buttons. Play and Stop perform corresponding actions with the current effect. The button with the piano keys shows or hides the virtual piano window (see <a href=#piano>below</a>).
<br><br>
At the right of the bar there are bank controls. [Add] appends an effect to the end of the bank. [Del] deletes current effect. Next four buttons with two numbers (current effect and total number of effects in bank) in between are to navigate between effects. Double arrows are to go to the first and the last effect in the bank. Last in the bar there is effect name. You can edit it by clicking it with left mouse button, entering a new name, and pressing Enter to confirm changes. Some hotkeys won't work while the name editor is active.
<br><br><br>
All remaining space of the program window is the effect editor. You can use either mouse or keyboard to edit values. There are few columns. Pos is frame number. You can select frames with LMB on the frame number or deselect them with RMB. T, N are the AY mixer bits, edited similar to the selection. Per is the tone period. Ns is the noise period. V is the volume. When you click on any of Per, NS or V value, cursor moves to the frame. In the right part of the window the same values are represented in graphic form, they can also be edited using mouse buttons. When the Ctrl button is held down, mouse won't move horizontally, allowing easier drawing a sequence of the same values.
<br><br>
The editor window can be resized vertically with one frame step, but can not be resized horizontally.
<br><br><br>
<a name=piano></a>
There is a special window to simplify creation of sound effects based on musical notes. It can be brought with the button with piano keys or through View->Piano Input item of the main menu. At the left part of the window there is a hint which keyboard buttons correspond to notes. At the right there are controls that affect to the input. The Octave field sets up the current octave (1...8). The Step field sets up the number of frames that the cursor will advance after entering a note. The Fill field sets up how many subsequent frames will be set to the same value with a single note input. The Link button links Step and Fill fields, matching up the fill value to the step. When the Set T button is down, T flag is set for frame at note input, when it is up, existing T value of a frame won't be changed. Set Volume does the same for volume column, entering value that can be changed at the right of the button.

<p id=txt class=lfx>
Following file formats are supported.
<br><br>
<i>PSG</i>
<br><br>
AY registers dump. Files with complete 16-byte header are supported. These files could be created with AY Emulator or Z80Stealth. You can select channel that will be source of data before import. Auto option will select the channel where the volume changes first, with automatic skip of the pause before. Tone, noise, volume, and mixer settings of selected channel will be imported. To simplify things, it is better to use source files with single channel effects.
<br><br>
<i>VTX</i>
<br><br>
AY registers dump. These files could be created with AY Emulator and UnrealSpeccy. Import options are the same as for PSG.
<br><br>
<i>VGM</i>
<br><br>
Registers dump for SN76489 or compatibles, the sound chip that has been used in Master System, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, ColecoVision, and some other computers or game consoles. The imported data is adapted to get similar sound, but as the chip capabilities are quite different, there will be difference.
<br><br>
<i>WAV</i>
<br><br>
Only standard, unpacked PCM files supported, of any sample rate, bits depth, mono or stereo. Volume envelope gets imported, tone pitch gets analyzed. If it is possible to detect pitch for a frame, T flag sets along with the pitch value, otherwise N flag sets.
<br><br>
</p>



<p id=txt class=lfx><a href=#conte title="? ??????????"><b>^</b></a> <a name=expor><b>Export effects</b></a></p>
<p id=txt class=lfx>
Following file formats are supported.
<br><br>
<i>VTII Instrument</i>
<br><br>
Vortex Tracker II instrument, which is a plain text file. Export dialogs allows to set a base note that should be used to get original pitch in the tracker.
<br><br>
<i>WAV</i>
<br><br>
Standard uncompressed PCM file, 44100 Hz, 16 bit, mono.
<br><br>
<i>CSV</i>
<br><br>
Comma separated values in a text file. Can be handy for further parsing and processing with external tools.
<br><br>
<i>Current effect</i>
<br><br>
When this item is checked, export functions will export current effect only, under specified filename.
<br><br>
<i>All effects</i>
<br><br>
When this item is checked, export functions will export all effects from the bank. The filename can have an optional prefix with effect number and name, this can be selected as the file type in the export dialog.
<br><br>
</p>



<p id=txt class=lfx><a href=#conte title="Back to contents"><b>^</b></a> <a name=forma><b>File formats</b></a></p>
<p id=txt class=lfx>
16-bit numbers stored in the LSB,MSB format.<br><br>
<i>Single effect, file extension .afx</i>
<br><br>
Every frame encoded with a flag byte and a number of bytes, which is vary depending from value change flags.
</p>
<pre>
 bit0..3  Volume
 bit4     Disable T
 bit5     Change Tone
 bit6     Change Noise
 bit7     Disable N
</pre>
<p id=txt class=lfx>
When the bit5 set, two bytes with tone period will follow; when the bit6 set, a single byte with noise period will follow; when both bits are set, first two bytes of tone period, then single byte with noise period will follow. When none of the bits are set, next flags byte will follow.
<br><br>
End of the effect is marked with byte sequence #D0, #20. Player should detect it before outputting it to the AY registers, by checking noise period value to be equal #20. The editor considers last non-zero volume value as the last frame of an effect, other parameters aren't matter.
<br><br>

<i>Effects bank, file extension .afb</i>
<br><br>
Header:
<br><br>
+0 (1 byte) Total number of effects in the bank, up to 256 (0 means 256);<br>
+1 (2 bytes per effect) Table of offsets to data of every effect. Offset value is given relative to the second byte of the offset itself, this allows to calculate absolute address very fast:
<br><br>
</p>
<pre>
   hl=offset in the effects table
   ld c,(hl)
   inc hl
   ld b,(hl)
   add hl,bc
   hl=absolute address of effect data
</pre>
<p id=txt class=lfx>
Data:
<br><br>
+n (m bytes) The effects data, format is the same as in the single effect file. After every effect there could be a null terminated text string with name of the effect. It may absent, if the bank was saved into a file using corresponding item of the File menu, in this case null terminator bytes are absent as well.
</p><br><br>

<p id=txt class=lfx><a href=#conte title="Back to contents"><b>^</b></a> <a name=playe><b>ZX Spectrum player</b></a></p>
<p id=txt class=lfx>
The package includes a simple sound effects player. It is located at /z80player/ayfxplay.a80. This file is a text file with Z80 source code for asm80 cross assembler. There are comments on use and internals as well.
<br><br>
The player can play effects using all three AY channels. When there is an empty (not playing) channel, it will be used, otherwise the one that was active for longest time will be used. AY music can't play while this version of the player is active.
<br><br>
Besides the player, there is an example program, available as compiled SCL disk image and source code. All keys has sound effects assigned to them. Space key turns on/off music that is played on the second sound chip of TurboSound device (NedoPC version), if it is available. If the TurboSound is absent, music will play on the same chip, producing various sound artefacts.
